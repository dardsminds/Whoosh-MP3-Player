### Note:
I am no longer working on this project and made the code as open free for public who are interested, this is way too old that can only be run on old version of Windows from Win98 and lower version, the files here includes compiled executable files and some library files
from third party library, although they are scanned in my machine for viruses but please do scan again for any virus before using them,  I am not held responsible for any damage that may arise in your 
machine, so use this program at your own risk!!!
