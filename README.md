Whoosh MP3 is a perfect solution in music automation for Radio, party or personal, it is known for its perfect intelligent music mix-point detection, with additional some features like; 
Manual crossfading, equalizer, Digital Sound Processor, Auto Gain Control, Media Library, Digital CD playing, Music Category, MP3 tag, Mix-point manual editing and lots more.

I started working on this software since 2003 inspired by OTS DJ software from https://otsav.ots7.com , I cannot afford to get buy this software from Otslab so I created my own mp3 player, I keep on updating it until I am happy with the outcome.

### Note:
I am no longer working on this project and made the code as open free for public who are interested, this is way too old that can only be run on old version of Windows from Win98 and lower version, the files here includes compiled executable files and some library files
from third party library, although they are scanned in my machine for viruses but please do scan again for any virus before using them,  I am not held responsible for any damage that may arise in your 
machine, so use this program at your own risk!!!
