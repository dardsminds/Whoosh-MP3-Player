WHY I CREATED THE WHOOSH MP3?
Last February 2003, some FM Radio station ask me to fixed their computer,
those computer was used to play music on that station, they use OTSJUKE one
of the popular music player used by most FM station, lately I found myself
downloading the demo version of this program from the internet, because I like
the way it mixes, but some disadvantage of this program is that it need to
convert Mp3 file first to .Ots type, anyway those disadvantages was overcome
by some features like real time vinyl scratch effect, mix point detection, etc. 
I also tried other program like BPM studio, well a nice one but I can't run
this to my 640x480 screen, also PCDJ(silver) whew! it hangs my Pentium 366Mhz
computer, ah this program needs to run on Pentium III or higher instead, but 
how about ATOMIX MP3? well a sharpest beat detection technology hmm! a really
cool customizable mp3 players I even create my own skinned player, any way
it can beat mix for almost 75% of disco music, but good it you do it manually
mixing using this AtomixMP3.
But how about Whoosh MP3?. from those that I mentioned above I still not satisfied
the way it play and mix music but all of them is great!.
In the middle of April 2003, i found a CD that contain source code of how to 
play Mp3 without the use of Media player, so I started to work on it, by the way
I am just a computer technician, programming is just my experience, using
BASS multimedia library, all the thing that I need for a perfect MP3 player 
was made possible, thanks to BASS. Now I gathered all the good idea from the
great Music player and implement it to my Whoosh. 
I publish the program on the internet with source code and find people who can
suggest or can give comments, until Whoosh improved and up to currently version 1.11 now,
frankly I had been addicted to this program, and sometimes get trouble with my wife
because of this Whoosh MP3 :). 
I create this program for personal used, but I'd like to share this to the other
that's why its free. I am still enhancing this program to satisfy the needs of
other who like to use this Whoosh Mp3 as their Music player, but I don't have
any intention to compete this to other software.
